            <h1>Why Morocco?</h1>
            <h2>Morocco, the gateway to Africa</h2>
            <p>
                Morocco, known as Al Maghrib in Arabic, stands as a vibrant crossroads where African, Arab, and European cultures blend seamlessly. With a history spanning millennia, Morocco has been shaped by Berber tribes, Arab conquests, and European influences, especially French and Spanish. This rich tapestry of cultures has created a nation unlike any other in North Africa.
            </p>
            <p>
                Living in Morocco for seven months and delivering my baby in Gueliz taught me to appreciate the country's remarkable contrasts. Beyond the bustling souks filled with artisans crafting intricate wares, tranquil riads offering respite from the desert heat, and world-class restaurants serving authentic Moroccan cuisine, you can still wander the ancient medinas and feel centuries of history beneath your feet, taking in the terracotta walls, ornate tilework, and on the horizon, the majestic Atlas Mountains capped with snow.

                        <h5>How to experience it:</h5>

                        <h5>Why it's amazing</h5>
                        <p>Where else can you have breakfast in Africa and lunch in Europe? The proximity to Spain makes Morocco uniquely positioned as a bridge between continents, cultures, and cuisines.</p>
